//Just like you can add methods to your own constructor, you can also add methods and properties to built in classes in JavaScript like Arrays and Objects.

//Add a reverse method to the String 'class' so that every instance of String can call reverse and reverse itself.
String.prototype.reverse = function(){
  var s = "";
    var i = this.length;
